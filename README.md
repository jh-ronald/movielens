# movielens

This project is a Capstone Project in the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate programme. 
I am to build a Movie Recommendation System with R. 
The movielens dataset used in this project is a 10M version (found at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/) of the full original dataset (found at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/).
